# Single parent households in America have become more and more prevalent in recent times. Many families headed by a single parent suffer from poverty. Poverty in turn results in many other dysfunctional status such as substance abuse, criminal activity, and lack resources to attain education. 

Single parenting in America is a reality for many people, however for African Americans it seems to be more prevalent than other races. As an African American single parent, I want to see if there is any correlation between education, income, and single parenting on the marriage rates of African Americans overall.

In this project I will be analyzing multiple datasets from the Census bureau and supporting datasets from the Labor Department to see if there is any correlation of the decline of Marriage across the United States to income, education, and homeownership with an emphasis on African Americans.

The variables that will be analyzed will be marital status of three races: African American, White American, and Hispanic American along with income, education, homeownership. 



1. Is there a relationship between location in America and the rise of single parenting overall? What states have higher instances of marriage?
2. Is there a correlation between the rise of single parenting and income and/poverty limits overall? if so, how does that look for African American in comparison to the overall?
3. What is the relationship between marriage and education. Is there more chance that African Americans with higher education will get married. 
4. Is there a correlation between the rise of single parenting overall and homeownership and how does it compare to that of African American
