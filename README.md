##Motivation
I am an African American single mom. I have never been married and I have two children. My mom is married to my dad and has been for over 45 years. However, my grandmother on my mom’s side was also never married with two kids while my dad’s mom was married for years with 11 kids. I wanted to explore if location plays any part on the number of single parents and then see how African Americans compare to other races that are single parents. I want to also explore if education, homeownership, and income play any role the number of single parents overall and then drill down to see how that these same factors compare to the African American community. 

##Questions

1. Is there a relationship between location in America and the rise of single parenting overall? What states have higher instances of marriage?
2. Is there a correlation between the rise of single parenting and income and/poverty limits overall? if so, how does that look for African American in comparison to the overall?
3. What is the relationship between marriage and education. Is there more chance that African Americans with higher education will get married. 
4. Is there a correlation between the rise of single parenting overall and homeownership and how does it compare to that of African American
